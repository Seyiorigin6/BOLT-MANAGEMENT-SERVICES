# 🌍 **Project Overview**

This system is a simplified clone of a ride-hailing platform like **Bolt**, developed strictly as a **website (no mobile app)**.  
The system supports:

- Passengers booking rides  
- Drivers accepting & completing rides  
- Admins managing the platform and generating reports  

The project demonstrates:

- Real-world entity modeling  
- SQL database creation and normalization  
- Functional PHP + MySQL integration  
- A fully working frontend with Bootstrap UI  
- Reporting and querying capabilities

# 🧰 **Technology Stack**

This is the **final, approved** technology stack used in the project.

## **Frontend**
- HTML5 – Page structure  
- CSS3 – Styling  
- Bootstrap 5 – Responsive UI  
- Vanilla JavaScript – Dynamic actions, AJAX, validation  
- (Optional) jQuery – If needed for AJAX/DOM simplification  

## **Backend**
- PHP 7/8  
  - Authentication  
  - Booking workflow  
  - Ride lifecycle  
  - Session handling  
  - CRUD operations  

Security features include proper password hashing, verification, and input sanitization.

## **Database**
- MySQL  
  - ERD → Logical → Physical  
  - Normalization  
  - Constraints  
  - SQL scripts  
  - Reports & queries  


## **Tools**
